        <p class="h3-text">Creating your own website may seem intimidating at first, but with some basic knowledge of HTML and CSS,
            you'll be well on your way to building an online presence. In this simple guide, we'll explore the essential
            steps to create a website using only HTML and CSS.</p>

        <h3>Getting Started with HTML</h3>
        <p class="h3-text">HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language, is the foundation of any website. It is the language used to structure
            the content and elements of a web page.</p>

        <h2>Setting up the HTML Document</h2>
        <p>Start by creating a new blank file with the extension .html. Then, define the document type using the tag
            &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;. This tag informs the browser that the document is a valid HTML file.
        </p>

        <h2>Creating the Basic Structure</h2>
        <p>Inside the HTML file, add the &lthtml&gt,&lt;head&gt;, and&lt;body&gt; tags. The &lt;html&gt; tag represents
            the root element of the document, while&lt;head&gt; is used to provide information about the document, such
            as the title and metadata. The&lt;body&gt; tag contains all the visible content of the site.

        <h2>Adding Content Elements</h2>
        <p> Within the &lt;body&gt;, you can add content elements such as headings, paragraphs, images, and links. Use
            the appropriate tags, like &lt;h1&gt; for headings, &lt;p&gt; for paragraphs, &lt;img&gt; for images, and
            &lt;a&gt; for links.
        </p>

        <h3>Styling with CSS</h3>
        <p class="h3-text">CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, allows you to customize the appearance of your website. It controls the look
            of HTML elements, such as colors, fonts, and layout.</p>

        <h2>Creating a CSS File</h2>
        <p> Create a new blank file with the extension .css. This file will be used to write the style rules for your
            website.
        </p>

        <h2>Linking CSS to HTML</h2>
        <p> Within the &lt;head&gt; section of your HTML document, add the &lt;link&gt; tag to connect the CSS file to
            your site. Make sure to specify the correct path to the CSS file.
        </p>

        <h2>Applying Styles</h2>
        <p> In the CSS file, you can select HTML elements using selectors and apply styles to them. For example, you can
            set the text color using the "color" property and the font size using the "font-size" property.
        </p>
